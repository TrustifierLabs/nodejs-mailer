# Pige-A-Matic 
*see (etymology below)

The not so smart extractor of emails, telephone numbers, names and other
bits of contact info from semi-structured files.


# Etymology

Pige-A-Matic is a misnomer. This software was dubbed so by Lord psmedia90

Somewhat loose justification: Because it's really boring to name something 
"contact-extractor" and Twelfth Night was already claimed by the Bard.
